# Mizumi Labs

Mizumi Labs is an open-source research lab focused on building practical, data-centric infrastructure around new technologies.

We work on tools and reference implementations such as headless RAG frameworks, document-to-knowledge-graph pipelines (e.g. PDF to SPARQL), and modular agent architectures that support local and remote tool execution. Rather than end-user products, we prioritize composable primitives, clear interfaces, and systems that can be inspected, adapted, and extended.

Our research explores emerging ideas like agentic operating systems, tool-oriented chat environments, and protocol-driven execution layers, with an emphasis on structure, interoperability, and long-term usability over model-specific optimizations.

Mizumi Labs exists to support builders and researchers working at the intersection of data, infrastructure, and intelligent systems through open experimentation, shared tooling, and transparent research.
